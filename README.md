# Avalanche-Assessment
This project is a final assessment in Avalanche ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course, Functions & Errors

# Description
The RectangleArea smart contract is designed to allow users to define the dimensions of a rectangle by setting its length and width. It calculates the area of the rectangle while implementing error handling using require(), revert(), and assert() statements to ensure valid inputs and internal logic.


# Getting Started
Executing the program
To get started, navigate to Remix - an online Solidity IDE, at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Create a new file in the contracts folder, then save the file with a .sol extension. Proceed to copy and paste the Solidity code available in this repository.

To compile, navigate to the Solidity compiler tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure that the Compiler version is set to 0.8.27 (or other compatible version). Then, click the compile button.

Navigate to the Deploy & run transactions tab, then proceed to click the Deploy button to deploy the contract on the Remix environment.

After deployment, go to the Deployed/Unpinned Contracts section and proceed to interact with the available functions of the program.

Use the available functions to set the length and width, and calculate the area.
